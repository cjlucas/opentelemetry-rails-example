# OpenTelemetry âˆ© Rails

A reference repository for instrumenting Rails apps. It presents what can be achieved using generally available self-hosted software, as opposed to leveraging observability cloud providers. It's suited for testing and debugging, not as a guidance for production setups.

It's _opinionated_ in the way that included libraries and solutions do have alternatives. The main intention though is to stick with Open Source and Open Standards. I'm willing to see suggestions and discussions about different approaches.

The repository is being gradually updated as Open Telemetry SDK and Open Telemetry Contrib Packages for Ruby progress (the Ruby OTel SDK doesn't support metrics and traces yet).

I recommend visiting [open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo) for a complete example of instrumentation of a distributed system.

# Short demo

# Included tech stack

What's being observed:

- [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) app (HTTP service)
- [Sidekiq](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq) app (background processing)

Services used for gathering and accessing telemetry data:

- [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/send-data/promtail/) and [Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/) for logs
- [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) and [Tempo](https://github.com/grafana/tempo) for tracing
- [statsd_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter) and [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) for metrics
- [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) for visualization

# Logs

The [rails_semantic_logger](https://github.com/reidmorrison/rails_semantic_logger) gem is used in the Rails app to produce and output logs to the `STDOUT`. Then, **promtail** scraps logs from the docker's standard output and pushes them to **Loki**. **Loki** stores the logs and makes them available for querying in **Grafana**.

Logs are outputted in the `fmt` format. In addition to standard fields, there are extra fields included: `request_id`, `trace_id`, `span_id` and `operation`.

# Traces

The Rails app is auto-instrumented with suitable Open Telemetry Contrib packages. The list of all available packages can be found on the [OpenTelemetry registry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/?s=&component=&language=ruby).

Traces produced by the instrumentation are being sent to the **OpenTelemetry Collector**. Then, **OpenTelemetry Collector** exports them to **Tempo** which stores the traces and makes them available for querying in **Grafana**.

# Metrics

Metrics are emitted in the **StatsD** style. Currently, the only instrumentation is the [statsd-rack-instrument](https://rubygems.org/gems/statsd-rack-instrument) measuring HTTP requests.

Metrics are sent to the `statsd_exporter` which then aggregates and exposes metrics in the **Prometheus** format. **Prometheus** scraps the `statsd_exporter`, stores and makes metrics available for querying in **Grafana**.

# Correlating logs, traces and metrics

The real synergy comes from correlating all the pillars of observability - logs, traces, and metrics - together. It's super convenient to easily navigate from a log to a related trace or even from a spike in metric to a related trace. That's the main motivation behind including Grafana in the stack - a single UI that is capable of presenting and correlating all the data.
