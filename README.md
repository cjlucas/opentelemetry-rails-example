# OpenTelemetry âˆ© Rails

A reference repository for instrumenting Rails apps. It presents what can be achieved using generally available self-hosted software, as opposed to leveraging observability to cloud providers. It's suited for testing and debugging, not as a guidance for production setups.

It's _opinionated_ in a way that the included libraries and strategies do have alternatives. The main intention though is to stick with the Open Source and Open Standards. I'm willing to see suggestions and discussions about different approaches.

The repository is being gradually updated as Open Telemetry SDK and Open Telemetry Contrib Packages for Ruby progress.

# Short demo



# Included tech stack

What's being observed:

- [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) app (HTTP service)
- [Sidekiq](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq) app (background processing)

Services used for gathering and accessing telemetry data:

- [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/send-data/promtail/) and [Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/) for logs
- [Tempo](https://github.com/grafana/tempo) for tracing
- [statsd_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter) and [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) for metrics
- [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) for visualization

# Logs

The [rails_semantic_logger](https://github.com/reidmorrison/rails_semantic_logger) gem is used in the Rails app to produce and output logs to the `STDOUT`. Then, `promtail` scraps logs from the docker's standard output and pushes them to `Loki`. `Loki` stores the logs and makes them available for querying in Grafana.

# Traces

The Rails app is auto-instrumented with suitable Open Telemetry Contrib packages. The list of all available packages can be found on the [OpenTelemetry registry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/?s=&component=&language=ruby).

Traces produced by the instrumentation are being exported to `Tempo`. Tempo stores the traces and makes them available for querying in Grafana.


# Metrics

Metrics are emitted by the StatsD. See a lengthy explaination why this approach https://mkaz.me/blog/2023/collecting-metrics-from-multi-process-web-servers-the-ruby-case/
