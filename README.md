# OpenTelemetry âˆ© Rails

This repository is supposed to be a reference point for people interested in instrumenting Rails apps. The main intention is to present what can be achieved using generally available self-hosted software, as opposed to leveraging observability to cloud providers.

It's _opinionated_ in a way that the included libraries and strategies do have alternatives. I'm open to suggestions and discussions about different approaches.
